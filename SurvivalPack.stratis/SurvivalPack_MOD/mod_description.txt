Survival pack adds hunger & water stats, and adds in game items such as foods and fuel canisters usable with custom animations and sounds


Main Features:

	

	- double click an inventory item to use it
	
	- Modules are located in "Survival" Category
	
	- "Hunger, Thirst & Items Module": brings hunger & thirst to the Arma world and enables the double click feature to use items 
		
		Module Properties:
		
			Food Drain Multiplier: factor that multiplies player food drain, 0 to disable default food drain
			
			Food Drain (While Running) Multiplier: factor that multiplies food drain while player is running, 0 to disable food drain while running
			
			Food Drain (While Damaged) Multiplier: factor that multiplies food drain while player is damaged, 0 to disable food drain while damaged 
			
			Water Drain Multiplier: factor that multiplies player water drain, 0 to disable default water drain
			
			Water Drain (While Running) Multiplier: factor that multiplies water drain while player is running, 0 to disable water drain while running
			
			Water Drain (While Damaged) Multiplier: factor that multiplies water drain while player is damaged, 0 to disable water drain while damaged 
			
			Damage From Thirst or Hunger: damage which the player would take every 0.5s when the player's food or water value is zero, 0 to disable any damage 
			
			Food & Water Zero Warning Message Delay: the delay in which a system message would be displayed while the player's food or water value is zero 
			
			Enable First Person Mode: by default disabled, because due to game engine limitation on how the player character renders in first person I wasn't able to make the item object render in front of the player's arm, automatically player goes to third person when using an item, by enabling first person disables forced third person 
			
			Enable Canister (Fuel) refill: enables you refill your empty fuel canisters using gas pumps at gas station, by default enabled
			
			Enable Water bottle refill: enables you to refill your water bottles using a water pump
	
	- "Item Properties Module": sets food nutrition value, water value and consuming duration for items
	
		Module Properties: sets item properties of [<food_nutrition_value>(number), <water_value>(number), <consumeDuration>(number)]
		
	- "Strings Module": enables you to change the mod's messages, texts, action texts and icons
	
	
For Scripters:

	- for performance reasons, player's food and water values are stored locally on player, the same player on the same network machine can get the player's hunger and water value by using:
	
		// food & water value ranges from 0 to 1, 1 = max
		private _foodValue = player getVariable ["food", 1];
		private _waterValue = player getVariable ["water", 1];
	
	- however the above function won't work when a different network machine or server is getting the player's food and water value in MP, to get the player's food and water value across networks use "survivalpack_fnc_getHungerWater" function
	
		// gets target player's hunger & water value, use this function in replacement of getVariable, because the food and water values are stored locally on player for performance reasons
		[<player>] call survivalpack_fnc_getHungerWater; // returns nothing but sets three variables
	
		// example getting the first player's hunger & water value 
		
			[] spawn {
				_firstPlayer = allPlayers select 0;
				
			
				[_firstPlayer] call survivalpack_fnc_getHungerWater;
				
				waitUntil {!isNil "sp_recievedpacketvar_player"};
				waitUntil {_firstPlayer == sp_recievedpacketvar_player};
				
				
				systemChat format ["player '%1' actual food and water values are %2%4 %3%4", name sp_recievedpacketvar_player, sp_recievedpacketvar_food, sp_recievedpacketvar_water, "%"];
				systemChat format ["player '%1' displayed food and water values are %2%4 %3%4", name sp_recievedpacketvar_player, round(sp_recievedpacketvar_food * 100), round(sp_recievedpacketvar_water * 100), "%"];
			};
			
		// sets hunger & water value for target player, use -1 to avoid setting a value

		[<player>, <food_value>(0-1), <water_value>(0-1)] call survivalpack_fnc_setHungerWater
			
			
		// example setting the first player's hunger to 50%
			
			[allPlayers select 0, 0.5, -1] call survivalpack_fnc_setHungerWater;
